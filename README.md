## INTRODUCTION

A microwave test bench is an assembly of various microwave components, held together by Nuts & Bolts. It consists of a microwave source (Oscillator) at one end. The waves generated are led down by a wave guide through various components, so that the student can observe the propagation of waves, and their interaction and/or processing by various components.

### 1.	Klystron Power Supply
Klystron Power supply is a regulated power supply for operating low power klystron. Klystron power supply generates voltage required for driving the reflex klystron tubes like 2k25, 2k56, 2k22. It is absolutely stable, regulated and short circuit protected power supply. It has the facility to vary the Beam Voltage continuously and built in facility of square wave and saw tooth generators, for amplitude and frequency modulation.

### 2.	Reflex Klystron (Klystron mount with tube)
A waveguide of suitable length having octal base on the broad wall of the waveguide for mounting the klystron tube. It consists of movable short at one end of the waveguide to direct the microwave energy generated by the klystron tube. A small hole located exactly at the center of the broad wall of the waveguide is used to put the coupling pin of the tube as the electric field vector of EM energy is maximum at the center only. The maximum power transfer can be achieved by tuning of the movable plunger.


<img width="347" height="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c0ce1b3-8973-463a-9041-7e86f03e6813" />


### The Reflex Klystron
The reflex klystron, shown in Fig., employs a somewhat different stratagem to extract energy from an electron beam in the form of microwave oscillation. The anode of the klystron is a resonant cavity that contains perforated grids to permit accelerated electrons to pass through and continue their journey. Such electrons are not, however, subsequently collected by a positive electrode. Rather, they are deflected by a negatively polarized 'reflector' and are thereby caused to fall back into the cavity grids. The operational objective of the tube is to have such electrons return to the cavity grids at just the fight time to reinforce the electric oscillatory field appearing across these grids. When this situation exists, oscillations are excited and sustained in the cavity. Microwave power is coupled out of the cavity by means of a loop if coaxial cable is used, or simply through an appropriate aperture if a waveguide is used for delivering the power to the load. After the kinetic energy of the electrons has been given up to the oscillatory field of the cavity, the spent electrons fall back to the positive biased control grid where they are collected, thereby adding to control grid current. If the tube is not oscillating, a relatively high number of electrons are by the retarding field of the reflector with sufficient energy to pass through the cavity grids, thence to be collected by the control grid. However, when oscillations are sustained in the cavity,
            the falling electrons yield most of their

energy to the oscillating electric field appearing across the cavity grids. Such electrons are subsequently collected by the cavity grids, which in this function behave as the plate of an ordinary diode. Inasmuch as the spent electrons do not fall into the positive field of the control grid, a profound dip in control-grid current accompanies the onset of oscillation within the cavity.

 
 

### 3.	Isolator:
The microwave test bench includes an attenuator, and an isolator. Both of these help to stop the reflected power from reaching the oscillator and pulling the frequency of the cavity and Gunn diode off tune when the load impedance is varied. An isolator is a two port device that transmits microwave or radio frequency power in one direction only. It is used to shield equipment on its input side, from the effects of conditions on its output side; for example, to prevent a microwave source being detuned by a mismatched load. An ideal isolator transmits all the power entering port 1 to port 2, while absorbing all the power entering port 2.
An isolator in a non-reciprocal device, with a non-symmetric matrix.
To achieve non-reciprocity, an isolator must necessarily incorporate a non-reciprocal material. At microwave frequencies this material is invariably a ferrite which is biased by a static magnetic field. The ferrite is positioned within the isolator such that the microwave signal presents it with a rotating magnetic field, with the rotation axis aligned with the direction of the static bias field. The behavior of the ferrite depends on the sense of rotation with respect to the bias field, and hence is different for microwave signals travelling in opposite directions. Depending on the exact operating conditions, the signal travelling in one direction may either be phase-shifted, displaced from the ferrite or absorbed.

### 4.	Circulator
A circulator is a passive non-reciprocal three port device in which microwave or radio frequency power entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation only. There are two types of circulators and their [S] matrices i.e. Clockwise circulator and Counterclockwise circulator.
# Clockwise Circulator


<img width="482" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a326e1b8-556b-4743-8fa8-0203fd9d5026" />

# Counterclockwise Circulator

### 5.	Attenuator:
Attenuators are required to adjust the power flowing in a waveguide. Attenuators are of fixed, variable and rotary vane type, i.e.
Fixed: Any amount of fixed attenuation can be supplied between 3 to 40 dB. These attenuators are calibrated frequency band. Variable: Variable attenuators provide a convenient means of adjusting power level very accurately.


<img width="350" height="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c06c17f5-b6af-4095-b6fb-2938f14b0313" />

 

### 5.	Direct reading frequency meter
This Frequency Meter has convenient readout with high resolution is provided by long spiral dials. These dials have all frequency calibrations visible so you can tell at a glance the specific portion of each band you are measuring. Overall accuracy of these frequency meters is 0.17% and includes such variables as dial calibration. It is constructed from a cylindrical cavity resonator with a variable short circuit termination. The shorting plunger is used to change the resonance frequency of the cavity by
changing the cavity length. DRF measures the frequency directly. It is particularly useful when measuring frequency differences of small changes. The cylindrical cavity forms a resonator that produces a suck-out in the frequency response of the unit. This you would turn the knob until a dip in the response is observed.

### 6.	Slotted line section with probe carriage:
The slotted line represented the basic instrument of microwave measurements. With its help it is possible to determine the VSWR, attenuation, phase and impedances. The position of carriage (probe) can be read from a scale with its vernier. The total travel of probe carriage is more than three time of half of guide wavelength.This system consists of a transmission line (waveguide), a traveling probe carriage and facility for attaching/detecting instruments. The
slot made in the center of the broad face do not radiate for any power of dominant mode. The precision built probe carriage having centimeters scale with a vernier reading of 0.1 mm least count is used to note the position of the probe. Additionally slotted section can be used to measure reflection coefficient and the return loss.

### 7.	Crystal Detector:
The crystal detector (Detector mount) can be used for the detection of microwave signal. RF choke is built into the crystal mounting to reduce leakage from BNC connector. Square law characteristics may be used with a high gain selective amplifier having a square law meter calibration. At low level of microwave power, the response of each detector approximate to square law characteristics and may be used with a high gain selective amplifier having a square law meter calibration.

### 8.	VSWR Meter
The SWR meter or VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio) meter measures the standing wave ratio in a
transmission line. The meter can be used to indicate the degree of mismatch between a transmission line and its load (usually a radio antenna), or evaluate the effectiveness of impedance matching efforts.


<img width="359" height="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/934636d0-2768-4c0c-9cf6-ce34af3ed691" />


### Ways to express VSWR
The reflection coefficient is what you'd read from a Smith chart. A reflection coefficient with magnitude of zero is a perfect match and a value of one is perfect reflection. The symbol for reflection coefficient is uppercase Greek letter gamma (     ). Note that the reflection coefficient is a vector, so it includes an angle. Unlike VSWR, the reflection coefficient can distinguish between short and open circuits. A short circuit has a value of -1 (1 at an angle of 180 degrees), while an open circuit is one at an angle of 0 degrees.The return loss of a load is merely the magnitude of the reflection coefficient expressed in decibels. The correct equation for return loss is:
Here are the equations that convert between VSWR, reflection coefficient and return loss:

### 9.	Different types of Antennas available    Conical Horn :
It is also called as waveguide fed Conical Horn. The conical horn antenna is a practical microwave antenna, often used as a feed for communication / satellite dishes and radio telescopes. Although the axial symmetry makes it capable of handling any polarization of the exciting fundamental (TE11) mode, the pin-fed horn design provided here is for linearly polarization.
There are a number of permutations on the basic horn
design which can serve to minimize the effects of diffractions, improve pattern symmetry and reduce the side lobe levels. These include corrugating the internal walls, curving the walls at the aperture, incorporating corrugations with the wall curvature at the aperture, and introducing higher order modes in the horn to reduce the field at the aperture edges. A lens is often placed across the aperture to compensate for phase error and thus narrow the beam width.
   Parabolic Dish:
A parabolic antenna is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a surface with the cross- sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it is highly directive; it functions analogously to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains that is they can produce the narrowest beam width angles, of any antenna type. They are used as high-gain antennas for point-to-point radio, television and data communications, and also for radiolocation (radar), on the UHF and microwave (SHF) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The relatively short wavelength of electromagnetic radiation at these frequencies allows reasonably sized reflectors to exhibit the desired highly directional response.
With the advent of TVRO and DBS satellite television dishes, parabolic antennas have become a ubiquitous feature of the modern landscape, not only in rural locales where CATV and terrestrial signals were limited or non-existent, but also in urban and suburban regions, where the aforementioned services compete with CATV and broadcast media. Extensive terrestrial microwave links, such as those between cell phone base stations, and wireless WAN/LAN applications have also proliferated this antenna type. Earlier applications included ground-based and airborne radar and radio astronomy.
Although the term dish antenna is often used for a parabolic antenna, it can connote a spherical antenna as well, which has a portion of spherical surface as the reflector shape.

## TYPES OF PARABOLIC DISH:
Parabolic antennas are distinguished by their shapes:


<img width="338" height="509" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ccc5fb-0e18-4539-93a9-2f6e82f48d24" />


Cylindrical - The reflector is curved in only one direction and flat in the other. The radio waves come to a focus not at a point but along a line. The feed is often a dipole antenna located along the focal line. It radiates a fan-shaped beam, narrow in the curved dimension, and wide in the uncurved dimension. The curved ends of the reflector are sometimes capped by flat plates, to prevent radiation out the ends, and this is called a pillbox antenna.
Orange peel - Another type is very long and narrow, shaped like the letter "C". This is called an orange peel design, and radiates an even wider fan beam. It is often used for radar antennas.
Paraboloidal or dish - The reflector is shaped like a paraboloid. This is the most common type. It radiates a narrow pencil-shaped beam along the axis of the dish.
Shrouded dish - Sometimes a cylindrical metal shield is attached to the rim of the dish. The shroud shields the antenna from radiation from angles outside the main beam axis, reducing the side lobes. It is sometimes used to prevent interference in terrestrial microwave links, where several antennas using the same frequency are located close together. The shroud is coated inside with microwave absorbent material. Shrouds can reduce back lobe radiation by 10 dB.
They are also classified by the type of feed; how the radio waves are supplied to the antenna:
Axial or front feed - This is the most common type of feed, with the feed antenna located in front of the dish at the focus, on the beam axis. A disadvantage of this type is that the feed and its supports block some of the beam, which limits the aperture efficiency to only 55 - 60%.
Offset or off-axis feed - The reflector is an asymmetrical segment of a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, is located to one side of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, so it doesn't block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal.
Figure (right) shows the main types of parabolic antenna feeds.
 

Cassegrain - In a Cassegrain antenna the feed is located on or behind the dish, and radiates forward, illuminating a convex hyperboloidalsecondary reflector at the focus of the dish. The radio waves from the feed reflect back off the secondary reflector to the dish, which forms the main beam. An advantage of this configuration is that the feed, with its waveguides and "front end" electronics does not have to be suspended in front of the dish, so it is used for antennas with complicated or bulky feeds, such as large satellite communication antennas and radio telescopes. Aperture efficiency is on the order of 65 - 70%.
Gregorian - Similar to the Cassegrain design except that the secondary reflector is concave, (ellipsoidal) in shape. Aperture efficiency over 70% can be achieved.
Gain:
The directive qualities of an antenna are measured by a dimensionless parameter called its gain, which is the ratio of the power received by the antenna from a source along its beam axis to the power received by a hypothetical isotropic antenna. The gain of a parabolic antenna is:



Where,

A is the area of the antenna aperture, that is, the mouth of the parabolic reflector

d is the diameter of the parabolic reflector

λ is the wavelength of the radio waves.

eA is a dimensionless parameter called the aperture efficiency. The aperture efficiency of typical parabolic antennas is 0.55 to 0.60.

### 10.	Magic Tee:
The magic tee is a combination of E and H plane tees. Arm 3 forms an H-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arm 4
forms an E-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arms 1 and 2 are sometimes called the side or collinear arms. Port 3 is called the H-plane port, and is also called the Sum port or the P-port (for Parallel). Port 4 is the E-plane port, and is also called the	(delta) port, difference port, or S-port (for Series).


The name "magic tee" is derived from the way in which power is divided among the various ports. A signal injected into the H-plane port will be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, and will be in phase. A signal injected into the E-plane port will also be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, but will be 180 degrees out of phase. If signals are fed in through ports 1 and 2, they are added at the H-plane port and subtracted at the E-plane port. Thus, with the ports numbered as shown, and to within a phase factor, the full scattering matrix for an ideal magic tee is

### 11.	E and H Plane Tee
In E Plane Tee the junction of the auxiliary arm is made on the broad wall of the main waveguide. And in H Plane Tee the junction of auxiliary arm is made on the narrow wall of the main waveguide.

### 12.	Matched Termination
These are used for terminating the waveguide systems operating at low average power and are designed to absorb all the applied power assuring low SWR. Where a matched load is required as in the measurement of reflection, discontinuities of obstacle in waveguide systems, these components are used. These are also employed as a precise reference loads with tee junctions, directional couplers etc.

### 13.	W/g Coaxial Adaptor:
These adapters consist of a short section of waveguide with a probe transition coax mounted on broad wall. It transforms waveguides impedance into coaxial impedance. Power can be transmitted in either direction. Each adaptor covers 50% of the waveguide band.
